          <h2>So it begins...</h2>
          <p>So this is the first post for my blog. I will be documenting my time in the Awesome Inc U bootcamp.
             This is the end of week one and we have done quite a bit in a short amount of time. This week we mainly focused 
             on html and bootstrap frameworks along with some procedural items. One of the coolest things that I have learned 
             this week is that with the bootstrap frame work you can add items to your page that can be resized on any device
             to promote cross-platform compatability. In learning these skills I feel that I am picking up momentum in my 
             journey to become a web developer. However with the momentum I have found some things I need to work on as well.
             I understand how to make everything functional and presentable but making everything look "good" is a challenge. 
             My skills in actually designing the page are lacking but I will find a way to overcome this shortcoming. I did 
             find one resource this week that I believe could be helpful to the class moving forward. The resource is a bulk 
             image resize tool. With this tool you can get your pictures to be a uniform size to be used in carousels on the 
             page. This post really just hits some highlights but as I learn I'm sure these posts wiil grow.
